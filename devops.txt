## Real-World Examples

1. E-Commerce Platform Deployment:
```yaml
# Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "Web Server"
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}

# CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'ansible-playbook deploy.yml'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2. Microservices Architecture:
```yaml
# Docker Compose
version: '3'
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
  database:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret
```

3. Monitoring Setup:
```yaml
# Prometheus Configuration
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'spring-boot-app'
    metrics_path: '/actuator/prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
```
